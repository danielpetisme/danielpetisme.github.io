title: Hello, World!

Hello guys!

Since we are in the resolution period, I decided to start this blog.
I'm thinking about writing for a really long time but as a *clich√©* engineer I tried to solve false problems before starting rather than just do... 

So finally here I am and these are the blog's rules:

1. You don't talk about the Fight Club.
2. If I get stuck on a problem more than 15 minutes, then it deserves a post.
3. A suite of little posts VS. a huge one.
4. I'll try to do my best to write an ~~correct~~ understandable english.
5. Share!
 
I hope you will enjoy it as much as me.

Oh, and by the way, **Happy new year**

Daniel
